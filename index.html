      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>

      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I really ejoyed making my first portfolio website in high school. I used wix or wordpress and wanted more creative freedom on designing my own site. I took an entry level HTML course and was amazed at all the customizations I could do just form writing some code. I also have a design background so want to take my design and coding expereince to work in UX/UI eventually. Everyone has told me how important of a skill being a web developer is and I'm just excited to broaden my horizons and challenge myself! </p>
